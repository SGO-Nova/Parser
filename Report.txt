1)    Data Structures:
    Linked-Lists: We used the linked lists to operate as tokens in order to set up the necessary tokens to represent the context-free-grammer used by the parser.

    Multi-child Tree: This tree will be used primarily in the Tree_Process & Create_Token functions where we create and functionalize the tokenizer tree. 

    Arrays: Required in order to store the contents from the txt file.

    Queue: The queue is used in order to temporarily store the recorded data from the tokenizer tree until they are ready to be printed out.
